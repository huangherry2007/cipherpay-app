# Suppress deprecation warnings from react-scripts and its dependencies
# These warnings are from transitive dependencies we can't control directly
audit-level=moderate
fund=false

# Note about deprecation warnings:
# - Most come from react-scripts@5.0.1 and its deep dependency tree
# - These are harmless warnings about packages no longer maintained
# - They don't affect app functionality
# - To truly eliminate them, we'd need to migrate from Create React App to Vite
#
# Note about security vulnerabilities:
# - Remaining vulnerabilities are in build tools (webpack-dev-server, svgo)
# - They don't affect production builds or runtime security
# - Fixing them would require migrating away from react-scripts (breaking change)
# - For production: the built assets are safe
